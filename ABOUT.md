# what's needed to finish this application:

1. this application requires knowledge about alot of modules (GPIO,GPTM,UART,ADC)
2. also needs to know how to use them with interrupts 
___

# steps I made:

1. I started with the GPIO interrupts and the UART and tested them
2. then I wrote the GPTM and tested it with interrupts
3. I learned first how to use the ADC module then I wrote its code
4. I used the temperature sensor embedded in the ADC module input and the GPTM to interrupt the ADC
___

# previous experience:

1. currently I'm enrolled in embedded systems diploma and I accomplished a progess in learning 
2. I've a strong knowledge in c and embedded c and working with micro controller during the faculty course (microprocessors)
3. I've done mini projects using different modules and a distance meter that measures the distance very accurately using ultrasonic sensor and 7 segemts to display the distance in cm
   you can find the code in this github repository:

4. the code for this test is found in:
   [xiot test code](https://github.com/fadyFaragallah/Xiot_test)
5. also I've done a project for RC car with many sensors(ultrasonic,line follower,...etc) using arduino
